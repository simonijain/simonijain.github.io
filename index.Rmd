I am a pre-doctoral fellow at the [Energy Policy Institute](https://epic.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago, where I am work with Professors [Ryan Kellogg](http://kelloggryan.com/) and [Thomas Covert](https://www.tcovert.com/) on projects focused on industrial organization and contract design in the US oil and gas economy. 
<p>

<p>
Before coming to UChicago, I was working at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/page/payments-and-governance-research-program) with Profs Karthik Muralidharan, Paul Niehuas and Sandip Sukhtankar, on a portfolio of subsidy payments and governance research projects in India.

<p>
I am interested in research topics at the intersection of development economics, political economy and industrial organization. Particularly, in understanding how can we map organizational structures to individual incentives and policy outcomes in the public versus private sector, with a focus on the *developing world*. 
<p>

<p>
I graduated from UChicago Harris School of Public Policy with a Masters in Policy Analysis [(MACRM)](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ma-public-policy-certificate-research-methods-macrm) in Fall 2019, where I completed the first year PhD coursework. I completed my BA (Honors) in Economics from University of Delhi.
