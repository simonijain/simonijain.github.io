<br> 

I am a 2nd year Phd student at University of California, Berkeley, in the [Business and Public Policy group](https://haas.berkeley.edu/bpp/) at the Haas School of Business. 

<p>
My research interests lie in labor economics, and I am currently exploring both questions that are central to labor markets in developing economies, and those that focus on US. 
<p>

<p>
Before moving to Berkeley, I was at UChicago, where I worked as a pre-doctoral fellow at the [Energy Policy Institute](https://epic.uchicago.edu/) with Profs Ryan Kellogg and Thomas Covert. I have also worked at [J-PAL South Asia](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/page/payments-and-governance-research-program) with Profs Karthik Muralidharan, Paul Niehuas and Sandip Sukhtankar, and Jeff Weaver. 
<p>


<p>
I graduated from University of Chicago with a Masters in Policy Analysis [(MACRM)](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ma-public-policy-certificate-research-methods-macrm) in 2019. I completed my BA (Honors) in Economics from University of Delhi, India.
